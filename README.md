I'm making a game where I have a simple target dummy and want to use animation parameters to keep track of if the target has been hit and is in a "Dead" state, to access via C# script to run some sound effects.
I needed a script behavior that when attached to an animation state, allows multiple actions to be placed in a list by the user in the editor that trigger parameter changes in the animator. 
This script was generated using ChatGPT but it's so useful I figured I should share it so anyone else making indie games can use it too!

Happy game making!
